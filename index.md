## Local Businesses Projects

### PROMOR
[PROMOR](https://promor.com.mx) is a business located in Veracruz, Mexico which is dedicated to provide parts for machinery related to coffee production.
This business has three branches in two cities, each branch has a different database that was not matching with the main local. This mismatch caused a lot of probles to keep track of actual sales and in general of the inventory.

I delivered a complete dabase with the three inventories synchronized, I matched the articles IDs and by descriptions since some products had same IDs with different descriptions or typos in the ID's input. Later on, I created a dashboard with basic business metrics that was connected to the administrative system (ASPEL) that keeps track of the sales through an API.

> Some parts have been censored as well as the dashboard of the actual deliverable due to confidentiality.

### Hotel bookings cancelation analysis

I analyzed the bookings cancelations of a hotel chain that owns two types of hotels: city hotels and resorts. I had to validate the hypothesis of the team about the likeliness of the bookings cancelations, find out the anual amount of savings to renegotiate with the agency due to unrealized bookings and give recommendations according to the findings.

#### Objectives
  - Organize and manipulate data in BigQuery.
  - Visualize results in Power BI.
  - Take decisions based on data.
  - Check business hypothesis.
