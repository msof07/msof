## Local Businesses Projects

### PROMOR
[PROMOR](https://promor.com.mx) is a business located in Veracruz, Mexico which is dedicated to provide parts for machinery related to coffee production.
This business has three branches in two cities, each branch has a different database that was not matching with the main local. This mismatch caused a lot of problems to keep track of actual sales and in general have a good control of the inventory.

I delivered a complete dabase with the three inventories synchronized, I matched the products by IDs and by descriptions since some products had same IDs with different descriptions or typos in the ID's input. Later on, I created a dashboard with basic business metrics that was connected to the administrative system (ASPEL) that keeps track of the sales through an API. Another objective was of the analysis was to create a customer categorization since the client didn't know to which customer he should offer better deals.

## Predictive Models

### MLB Predictive Model

This Machine Learning program is a practice project to put into practice the stages needed to deploy an actual model. The goal is to predict which team would win when given two teams as inputs. This is a long-term project starting from the heuristics as a first approximation and add granularity on the way.

## Laboratoria Projects

[Laboratoria](https://www.laboratoria.la/en) is a Latin American organization aimed at empowering women in the tech sector and preparing them to work as Developers and UX Designers for the last 10 years. Along with IBM I was awarded an scholarship to be part of the Data Analytics certification for which I completed the following projects described below. The dynamic of this certification offered me incredibly rewarding abilities aside from the technical skills such as give appropiate feedback to team members and take the lead in a diverse group.

### Hotel bookings cancelation analysis

I analyzed the bookings cancelations of a hotel chain that owns two types of hotels: city hotels and resorts. I had to validate the hypothesis of the team about the likeliness of the bookings cancelations, find out the anual amount of savings to renegotiate with the agency due to unrealized bookings and give recommendations according to the findings.

#### Objectives
  - Organize and manipulate data in BigQuery.
  - Visualize results in Power BI.
  - Take decisions based on data.
  - Verify business hypothesis.

### Client segmentation for e-commerce

The main premise of this project is to discover the client engagement of an online business through a cohort analysis with the objective to create client categories according to the objectives of the business to identify the best customers.

#### Objectives:
  - Pre-process data in spreadsheets.
  - Perform a cohort analysis and client segmentation through a RFM methodology.

### Startup client retention analysis

For this project I performed an analysis based on a set of data about customers who use a cloud management software. The main purpose is to obtain the retention rate and churn rate of the business.

#### Objectives:
  - Select and filter data using queries.
  - Perfom a cohort analysis.
  - Conclude on the Market Fit of the product.

### COVID-19 excess mortality analysis

In this project I performed an analysis using spreadsheets from a dataset on deaths in 5 Latin American countries to obtain the excess mortality due to COVID-19. 

#### Objectives:
  - Manipulate functions in spreadsheets.
  - Organize and visualize data in spreadsheets.
  - Determine relevant indicators.

## Backtesting Projects

These algorithms are written in the [QuantConnect](https://www.quantconnect.com) platform which gives you the environment to write your own algorithmic trading setups and also backtest (test how well a model would've performed on historical data) those strategies. The code is written with object-oriented programming in Python.
